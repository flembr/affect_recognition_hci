# Affect Recognition for HCI

This implementation is based on python with jupyter notebooks.

To be able to run the code you will need to install a anaconda virtual environment as described in 
  `requirements.txt`
Information on how to use anaconda can be found here: https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html 

Afterwards, start the jupyter environment with `jupyter notebook` from this directory in the console and start the notebooks in the browser window that pops up.

Extract the EmoDB-zip into this directory. 

The notebooks should then be self-explanatory.
